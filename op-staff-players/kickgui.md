# KickGUI

The KickGUI is a menu that makes it easy for you to kick any player on the server. There are 2 simple steps to complete a kick.

1. Click on the player head of the player you want to kick.
2. Confirm the kick,

When a player is kicked they will be made aware of the rules on the kick message so they can check their understanding before joining again. Once a staff member submits a kick an alert is sent to all online staff members so they are also aware.
