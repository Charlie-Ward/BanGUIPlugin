# BanGUI

The BanGUI is a menu that makes it easy for you to ban any player on the server. There are 4 simple steps to complete a ban.

1. Click on the player head of the player you want to ban.
2. Select the reason you want to ban this player.
3. Select the length you want this ban to be
4. Confirm this ban.

When a player is banned they will be kicked with the reason why and length of the ban on their ban screen. Once a staff member submits a ban an alert is sent to all online staff members so they are also aware.
